You're an aspiring junior dev on the lookout for your first tech job. You've had a few interviews and you just got a take-home technical challenge from a company looking for a C# developer.

Here's the challenge: build a C# console application for a bakery.

Pierre's Bakery
Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:

There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

The application will return the total cost of the order.

Pierre offers the following deals:

Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5.
Pastry: Buy 1 for \$2 or 3 for $5.
All functionality for the models should be tested.

// figure out whether dotnet test applies to multiple test files
// create a program.cs files
// add that exe reference in the csproj file

User interface:

Console.WriteLine // welcome message
Console.WriteLine // the cost of Bread
Console.WriteLine // the cost of pastries
Console.ReadLine // for the quantity of items ordered
Console.WriteLine // return the cost of the items

Backend logic:
build out two constructors for each class with the price and quantity fields and getter methods, maybe explicitly defined to retrieve private fields
additional methods for each class that calculate the total cost based on the price and the quantity
start with public fields; as the day evolves, change the access modifier to private and develop getter methods
